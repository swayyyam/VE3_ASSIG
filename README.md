Creating a Django-based web application that allows users to upload CSV files, performs data analysis using pandas and numpy, and displays the results and visualizations.

It provides the following main features:

Upload CSV Files: Users can upload CSV files using a form.

Data Analysis: The uploaded CSV file is analyzed to provide summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation, as well as histograms for numeric columns.

Data Visualization: Histograms are generated for each numeric column in the CSV file to visualize the data distribution.

Automatic Deletion: Uploaded CSV files are scheduled for deletion after 10 minutes to manage disk space.

Styles HTML tables for better visualization.
